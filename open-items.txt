- one changing focus, instantly save changes
  - on changing/closing tab, moving focus to other window/tab
- queue save actions
  - current save should be process after all pending save have send to backend & their response is processed  
    - just check if merge save action and send at once
  - merge patches to single pending action 
- perform save before changing month
  - not use middleware by removing action setMonthYear from ignoreActions list
- build issue
  - (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider:
  - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
  - Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks

unsolvable issue
- chrome issue
  - visibilitychange event fires only when debug console is closed
  - on mobile browser, beforeunload event not fire when closing tab, only fire when reloading tab
    - alert dialog is also not shown any case of beforeunload event
